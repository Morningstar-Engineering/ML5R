# ML5R
Morningstar ML5R Reorderable Loop Switcher

## Updating your ML5R
The ML5R is not designed to be updatable. The released firmware will work as is. But, in the event where we do release a new firmware and add some QOL features, we'll release the firmware here.

The ML5R has an internal Micro-USB port. You'll just need to:
1. Download the Morningstar Firmware Updater software
2. Download the ML5R Firmware in the `Release` section
3. Connect your ML5R to the computer via the Micro-USB port. The ML5R does not come with any USB cable.
4. Follow the instructions in the Firmware Updater software.
